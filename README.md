## NPlayVariability  

This repository is for storing results of simulations of N-Play variability for video poker.  The objective is to see how the theoretical covariance (and associated reduction in N-play variability) matches with theory.  
  
* 19-MAR-2016:  Initial code for Exercise002_v004 which runs through 9/6 Jacks simulations for 1/3/5/10/50/100 play  
* 20-MAR-2016:  Graphed quantiles for outcomes of 1-play and 3-play  
* 21-MAR-2016:  Automated quantile graphing, implemented storage of only "per every" to reduce file sizes  
* 22-MAR-2016:  Graphed results in percent as well as units
